# Map out technical solution for the food delivery site ExpressFood - Openclassrooms
ExpressFood needs you to make a database for them! It will need to contain: 

A list of clients

A list of the different daily menu items

A list of delivery people

An order history for each client

You will make a UML diagram to model this technical architecture. Once you're happy with the diagram, you'll create the actual MySQL database and fill it up with information (this data will obviously be made-up, but that's okay)!
