# Map out technical solution for the food delivery site ExpressFood - Openclassrooms
You've been recruited by a young startup called ExpressFood. ExpressFood delivers their own high-quality meals to residences in less than 20 minutes with their team of delivery bikers. ðŸš²

ExpressFood vous livre Ã  domicile en moins de 20 minutes !
ExpressFood delivers food to you in less than 20 minutes!
Every day, ExpressFood creates 2 main dishes and 2 desserts at its headquarters with the help of its experienced chefs. These 2 main dishes are stored in a cold setting, then given to delivery people who bike the food to the residence that requested it...in less than 20 minutes! 

On its website, ExpressFood allows clients to order one or multiple dishes and desserts. There are no fees for delivery. Menu items change every day. 

Once a client submits their order, they see a page displaying if the order has gone out for delivery yet, as well as an estimate for their meal's arrival time.

ExpressFood needs you to make a database for them! It will need to contain: 

A list of clients

A list of the different daily menu items

A list of delivery people

An order history for each client

You will make a UML diagram to model this technical architecture. Once you're happy with the diagram, you'll create the actual MySQL database and fill it up with information (this data will obviously be made-up, but that's okay)!
